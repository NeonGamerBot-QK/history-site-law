The process of creating a bill was if I wanted to create a bill for the state of Delaware you cannot watch talk tuah on a sunday, or the fourth of july.
To get this started I would write an email to my local congressman where they would get the bill drafted.
 After that it would go to a hopper and continue on for a committee hearing then to the markup process to be amended.
Once through the process of  mark up it will be passed to the rules committee. 
Once approved by the rules committee it will finally reach the area for a floor debate. in the case of a filibuster in the senate it will have to be resolved via a cloture which can take some time.
After it gets through the floor debate it will get passed to the  Conference Committee before finally getting sent to a higher up such as the president or a governor who will have the ability to veto the bill if needed. If it were vetoed  then the bill would have to start from the beginning if it is not overridden by congress. 
Then in the case my law doesnt get vetoed it will be implemented and enforced.
