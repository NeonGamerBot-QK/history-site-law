To get this started I would write an email to my local congressman where they would get the bill drafted and the bill signed. 
After that it would go to a hopper and continue on for a committee hearing which is usually in a subcommittee then to the markup process to be amended. After the discussion the bill would be reported out to the full committee.  Once through the process of the full committee it may need review by the Select Committee.
 Otherwise it will be passed to the rules committee. Which if approved by the Speaker of the House would move it to floor debate
When this process is mirrored in the senate,  where the Senate Majority Leader would lead it instead of the Speaker of the house.
Something that could happen is logrolling which could occur, where legislators agree to support each other's bills in exchange for other stuff to help get votes.
In the case of a filibuster in the senate it will have to be resolved via a cloture which can take some time.  After it gets through the floor debate it will get passed to the Conference Committee before finally getting sent to a higher up such as the 
 If it were vetoed  then the bill would have to start from the beginning if it is not overridden by congress. Then in the case my law doesnt get vetoed it will be implemented and enforced.
