    To get this started I would write an email to my local congressman where
    they would get the{" "}
    <span className="tooltip" data-tip="approved by legislator.">
      bill drafted
    </span>{" "}
    and the bill signed for not being allowed to watch talk tauh in delaware on
    sundays.
    {/* <img src={noTalkTauh} /> */}
  </p>,
  <p>
    After that it would go to a hopper and continue on for a{" "}
    <span
      className="tooltip"
      data-tip="committee gather to discuss about testamony"
    >
      committee hearing
    </span>
    which is usually in a{" "}
    <span
      className="tooltip"
      data-tip=" specialized group within a larger legislative committee "
    >
      subcommittee
    </span>{" "}
    then to the markup process to be amended. After the discussion the bill
    would be reported out to the full committee. Once through the process of the
    full committee it may need review by the{" "}
    <span className="tooltip" data-tip=" temporary legislative committee">
      Select Committee
    </span>
    .
  </p>,
  <p>
    Otherwise it will be passed to the rules committee. Which if approved by the
    <span
      className="tooltip"
      data-tip="officer of the US HoR (House of Representatives)"
    >
      {" "}
      Speaker of the House
    </span>{" "}
    would move it to floor debate
  </p>,
  <p>
    When this process is mirrored in the senate, where the Senate Majority
    Leader would lead it instead of the{" "}
    <span
      className="tooltip"
      data-tip="officer of the US HoR (House of Representatives)"
    >
      {" "}
      Speaker of the House
    </span>{" "}
  </p>,
  <p>
    Something that could happen is logrolling which could occur, where
    legislators agree to support each other's bills in exchange for other stuff
    to help get votes.
  </p>,
  <p>
    In the case of a filibuster in the senate it will have to be resolved via a
    cloture which can take some time. After it gets through the floor debate it
    will get passed to the Conference Committee before finally getting sent to a
    higher up such as the President who will have the ability to veto the bill
    if needed.
  </p>,
  <p>
    If it were vetoed then the bill would have to start from the beginning if it
    is not overridden by congress. Then in the case my law doesnt get vetoed it
    will be implemented and enforced. then there would be no talk tauh
